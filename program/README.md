This program is a lottery program in which staking rewards are distributed between winners. Players stake their Sol into our pool and with the received pool tokens they can create lottery tickets. If a player doesn't win a reward he doesn't lose Sol or tokens, his ticket is valid for the future draws. Players can return their tokens if they don't want to participate anymore loosing only potential staking reward.
