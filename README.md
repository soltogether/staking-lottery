# staking-lottery

to participate in staking always-winning lottery you need to do the following:

Go to: https://65a0cbf107f24f803dd51dc2--cheerful-paletas-7c50d4.netlify.app/

Connect your sol wallet funded with testnet tokens.

Choose "Create account" and after that "Create account step 2", sign when necessary.

On the "Prizes" dashboard choose "Go back".

Now you see numbers to choose for the lottery ticket and "User Address:" with account created. Below that you see the information about current token stored for tickets, token spent if were any, and token staked to cover the expenses.

First, you need to stake some tokens to the pool, doing that by entering stake amount (e.g. 1 sol) and pressing the 'Stake' button. You will need to confirm and sign the transaction. Second, you need to add tokens from the pool to the ticket account (e.g. 1 sol), and sign the transaction.

After that, you choose winning numbers for the ticket and press the 'Create Ticket' button with token amount for that ticket (e.g. 1 sol).

If you press 'My ticket' button you will see your current tickets and bets. You can 'Mark ticket' with winning numbers to get the reward or raise the bet for this ticket with 'Update ticket'. Deleting the ticket will lead to release of the tokens to the stored amount, so new tickets could be purchased, or released back to the stake.
